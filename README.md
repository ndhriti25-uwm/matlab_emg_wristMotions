# EMG Wrist Motion Analysis (MATLAB)

This project analyzes surface EMG (sEMG) signals collected during wrist motions.
The goal is to extract features (e.g., RMS) from EMG recordings and compare muscle
activation across different gestures and trials.

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — feature extraction and visualization currently under development.

## Data
EMG data files follow the naming convention:
session1_participant1_gestureX_trialY

## Methods (current)
- Signal loading and validation
- RMS feature extraction
- Trial aggregation
- Visualization (boxplots by gesture)

## Tools
- MATLAB
